# Active control for drill-string systems
It's well known that stick-slip vibrations existing in drill-string systems are extremely severe during drilling and are expected to mitigate or eliminate. Considering this practical probelm, we present a possible solution by using observer-based tracking controller, which only requires the top measurements and is easy to implement. This repository provides the code for the conference paper "Observer-Based Tracking Control for Suppressing Stick-Slip Vibration of Drillstring System". We hope this can provide help people who are working on the related fields.

Please note that, this code is limited to academic use only.
