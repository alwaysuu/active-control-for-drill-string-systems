# Active control for drill-string systems
It's well known that stick-slip vibrations existing in drill-string systems are extremely severe during drilling and are expected to mitigate or eliminate. Considering this practical problem, we present a possible solution by using observer-based tracking controller, which only requires the top measurements and is easy to implement. This repository provides the code for the conference paper "Observer-Based Tracking Control for Suppressing Stick-Slip Vibration of Drillstring System". We hope this can provide help to people who are working on the related fields.

Please note that, this code is limited to academic use only.
